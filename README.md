# PureScript Colorable Experiment

The goal is to build upon Brent Jackson's [excellent Colorable project](http://jxnblk.com/colorable/) by allowing users to _generate_ optimal color combinations based on a set of constraints.

## Milestones

* [X] Set background color from input component.
* [ ] Set background color from imported PureScript module.
